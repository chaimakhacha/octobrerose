        <h2 class="heading2">What is Breast Cancer?</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">Breast cancer is a complex disease that occurs when abnormal cells in the breast grow uncontrollably. These cells can form tumors that may spread to other parts of the body if left untreated.</p>

    <h2 class="heading2">Symptoms of Breast Cancer</h2>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>Lump or thickening in the breast or underarm</li>
        <li>Changes in the shape or size of the breast</li>
        <li>Dimpling of the skin</li>
        <li>Nipple changes, such as inversion, scaling, or discharge</li>   
        <li>Redness or pitting of the skin over the breast</li>
        <li>Pain in the breast or underarm</li>
    </ul>

        <h2 class="heading2">Risk Factors</h2>
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> The risk generally increases with age.</li>
            <li><strong>Family history:</strong>Having a family history of breast cancer, particularly if you have certain gene mutations like BRCA1 or BRCA2, can elevate your risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Hormonal factors:</strong> Exposure to estrogen over a long period, such as starting menstruation early or going through menopause late, can increase the risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Lifestyle factors:</strong>Factors like obesity, physical inactivity, and alcohol consumption can contribute to an increased risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical History:</strong>Certain medical conditions, such as dense breast tissue or a personal history of certain benign breast conditions, may slightly increase the risk.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="section4">
        <h2 class="heading2">Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>

        <p class="paragraph">Diagnosis of breast cancer involves various tests, such as:</p>
        
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Mammography</strong>: An X-ray of the breast.</li>
            <li><strong>Ultrasound</strong>: Uses sound waves to create images of the breast.</li>
            <li><strong>Biopsy</strong>: A procedure to remove a small sample of tissue for examination under a microscope.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="paragraph">Treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer, its type, and your overall health. Common treatments include:</p>
        
        <ul class="list">
            <li><strong>Surgery</strong>: To remove the tumor and sometimes nearby lymph nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemotherapy</strong>: To kill cancer cells throughout the body.</li>
            <li><strong>Radiation therapy</strong>: To kill cancer cells in a specific area.</li>
            <li><strong>Hormonal therapy</strong>: To block hormones that fuel cancer growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Targeted therapy</strong>: To target specific molecules involved in cancer cell growth.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="section" id="section5">
        <h2 class="heading2">Prevention and Early Detection</h2>

<p class="paragraph">While there's no guaranteed way to prevent breast cancer, adopting a healthy lifestyle, including a balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight, can reduce your risk. Early detection through regular self-exams and mammograms is crucial for better outcomes.</p>
